            <li>For a highschool project about books: I programmed a library automation with Windows Forms with the help of online resources. It was a time we students don't know anything about databases. I learn in the way, look at the online resources. I indirectly copy too while I need to learn with the tutor on the project. It was not a disadvantage but advantage for me on the road. I slowly get what most of the things mean. But despite that, I was still not be able to write that complex code by myself even smaller parts.</li>
