    <h1>My Interest and Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Trying to be a polymath in action</h2>
    <p>I really have lots of thing I wanna do but I have so many less things I do. I am trying to create the balance, trying to do what I want to do and so on.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Most of the Scientific Fields</strong>
            <p>I love science and the information we have about the cosmos itself. I wanna consume and have that information, read and understand the cosmos. Here are some of the examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mathematics</li>
                <li>Computer Science</li>
                <li>Philosophy</li>
                <li>Physics</li>
                <li>Chemistry</li>
                <li>Psychology</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <strong>Watching TV Shows, Movies and Youtube</strong>
            <p>I love watching, really. Some of the people don't even watch somethings, some of them watch regularly somethings. I watch so much movies and tv series, after that some youtube. I am trying to break myself from the bad portion of watching.<br>These are the categories I am consuming:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sci-fi and tech</li>
                <li>General popular series from most of the topics</li>
                <li>About games sometimes because I was playing games before</li>
                <li>Documentary sometimes</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
